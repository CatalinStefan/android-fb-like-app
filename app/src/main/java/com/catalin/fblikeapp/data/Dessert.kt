            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d4_wagashi, "Wagashi", "Japan", "Wagashi are traditional Japanese sweets that are usually made from natural, plant-based ingredients such as grains and azuki beans.

            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d6_doughnut, "Doughnut", "USA", "Although archaeologists had found some petrified remains of fried cakes with holes in the center, it is still unclear how could the early Native Americans prepare these delicious fried dough desserts that we know today as doughnuts.

            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d7_tiramisu, "Tiramisu", "Italy", "Even though tiramisù is actually a fairly recent invention, this dessert of coffee-soaked ladyfingers layered with mascarpone cream enjoys an iconic status among Italian desserts.

            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d8_milkshake, "Milkshake", "USA", "Milkshakes are usually described as flavored milk and ice cream beverages, usually lavishly decorated and served cold.

            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d9_macarons, "Macarons", "France", "These small, round, sweet meringue-based cookie sandwiches with filling in the middle are light and crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.

            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d12_dondurma, "Dondurma", "Turkiye", "Turkish ice cream is believed to originate from the city of Maraş—hence the name—and what really sets it apart from other varieties is its resistance to melting and a particularly dense, chewy texture. These qualities are brought by adding two thickening agents to the basic milk and sugar mixture: Arab gum, also known as mastic resin, and salep—a type of flour made from the root of the early purple orchid."),
            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d13_fudge, "Fudge", "USA", "Fudge is a creamy American confectionery made with milk, sugar, butter, and various toppings and flavorings.

            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d15_apple_pie, "Apple pie", "USA", "Although England has a long history of making meat and fruit pies, and it was the inspiration for the American versions, there is nothing that is more synonymous with American desserts than the apple pie. In the United States, apple pies are found everywhere from big grocery shops and restaurants to coffee shops and home bakers, baked until the double crust is golden brown, filled with cinnamon-sugar coated apples."),
            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d16_eclair, "Eclair", "France", "These elongated pastries with an appealing glaze, a crispy exterior, a soft doughy interior, and a sweet, creamy center originated in France at the turn of the 20th century. Most food historians believe they were invented by Marie-Antoine Carême, a famous French chef. Éclairs (French for lightning) are believed to have received their name because of how the light would reflect off of them after a coating of confectioner’s glaze."),
            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d17_pavlova, "Pavlova", "New Zealand", "Delicate as the ballerina it was named after, Pavlova is the quintessential summer dessert. Whipped cream is typically dolloped on top of a snowy meringue, followed by a pop of color in the form of fruit, preferably the tart varieties which contrast the sweetness of the meringue."),
            Dessert(getUUID(), R.drawable.d18_pannacotta, "Panna cotta", "Italy", "Simplicity at its finest, this softly set pudding takes almost no effort to make, yet is nothing short of amazing! Even though panna cotta (lit. cooked cream) wasn't mentioned in Italian cookbooks until the 1960s, today it is considered a traditional Piedmontese dessert, and the original recipe calls for only whole cream, sugar, vanilla, and gelatin."),
